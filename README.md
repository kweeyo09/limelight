# Limelight — Theatre Log

**Live:** <https://theatreboxd.vercel.app>

A theatre log of West End shows seen, kept as draggable ticket stubs on a
curtained stage. Built with **Next.js** (App Router, server API routes) and the
paper-cut "Limelight" UI from the Claude Design source.

## Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router) — SSR page + serverless API routes (the backend).
- **React 19** — interactive client UI (`components/TheatreLog.tsx`): the
  cursor-reactive curtains, draggable ticket stubs, and live search overlay.

## Architecture

```text
app/
  layout.tsx          fonts (Bodoni Moda + Spline Sans Mono) + metadata
  page.tsx            server component → reads lib/shows → renders <TheatreLog/>
  globals.css         extracted styles
  api/
    shows/route.ts    GET /api/shows         → full repertoire
    search/route.ts   GET /api/search?q=…    → filtered results
components/
  TheatreLog.tsx      client UI: curtains, draggable stubs, live search
lib/
  shows.ts            data layer (single source of truth; swap for a DB later)
```

The search overlay calls `GET /api/search` live, so the frontend is wired to the
backend rather than filtering a hardcoded array in the browser.

## Develop

```sh
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
```

## Build & run production

```sh
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Deploy (Vercel)

This app uses server API routes, so it runs on a Node host (not static GitHub
Pages). It's deployed on Vercel at <https://theatreboxd.vercel.app>, imported
from `kweeyo09/limelight`; every push to `main` redeploys automatically.

## Source

The visual design originates from a Claude Design project ("theatre web"),
authored in Claude Design's `.dc.html` runtime format. The implemented design is
the "Curtain Up" variant — fully-drawn crimson drapes with a spotlight pool
focusing the lit stage. Both source revisions are preserved for reference:

- [`Theatre Log - Curtain Up.dc.html`](Theatre%20Log%20-%20Curtain%20Up.dc.html) — current implemented design.
- [`Theatre Log.dc.html`](Theatre%20Log.dc.html) — earlier open-curtain revision.

This repo is a framework-ready implementation of it.
